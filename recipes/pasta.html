    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let's be honest, who doesn't know pasta in the entire world? Maybe just some old or full natural tribes that still persist for several and thousand years.</p>
    <p>Well but that is not the point, a good pasta, is one of the recipes that no one can decipher, so I might say "A good pasta is the one that you personaly enjoy".</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>I'm going to focus on one of my favorite recipes: the <strong>Spaghetti bolognese</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>4 rashers smoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>2 celery sticks</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 springs rosemary leaves</li>
        <li>500g beef mince</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>For the bolognese sauce:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes</li>
        <li>small pack basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 fresh bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>1 red chili deseeded (optional)</li>
        <li>125ml red wine</li>
        <li>6 cherry tomatos sliced in half</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>To season and serve</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>75g parmesan grated</li>
        <li>400g spaghetti</li>
        <li>crusty bread (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan on a medium heat and add 1 tbsp olive oil.</li>
        <li>Add 4 finely chopped bacon rashers and fry for 10 mins until golden and crisp.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and add the 2 onions, 2 carrots, 2 celery sticks, 2 garlic cloves and the leaves from 2-3 sprigs rosemary, all finely chopped, then fry for 10 mins. Stir the veg often until it softens.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high, add 500g beef mince and cook stirring for 3-4 mins until the meat is browned all over.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tins plum tomatoes, the finely chopped leaves from ¾ small pack basil, 1 tsp dried oregano, 2 bay leaves, 2 tbsp tomato purée, 1 beef stock cube, 1 deseeded and finely chopped red chilli (if using), 125ml red wine and 6 halved cherry tomatoes. Stir with a wooden spoon, breaking up the plum tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, reduce to a gentle simmer and cover with a lid. Cook for 1 hr 15 mins stirring occasionally, until you have a rich, thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the 75g grated parmesan, check the seasoning and stir.</li>
        <li>When the bolognese is nearly finished, cook 400g spaghetti following the pack instructions.</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and either stir into the bolognese sauce, or serve the sauce on top. Serve with more grated parmesan, the remaining basil leaves and crusty bread, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
